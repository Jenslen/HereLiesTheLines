This repository serves as a catalog for previous projects of particular note in my experience as a software development and Computer Science student. 
I have very shallow experience in many aspects of software, so while this repository is sparse now I will be adding to it and cataloging some of my most interesting final projects by genre and type. 

If there is nothing here yet please check back soon! I am probably still deciding what projects stand out the most.
